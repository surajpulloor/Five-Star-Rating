# Five-Star-Rating
A simple implementation of 5-Star Rating in HTML, CSS, Javascript (NO FRAMEWORKS!)

# What is this project
* Full 5-star implementation (Confused? [Check out the demo](https://surajpulloor.github.io/five-star/full-star))
* Half 5-star implementation (Confused? [Check out the demo](https://surajpulloor.github.io/five-star/half-star))

## Dependencies
* Nothing Really, I guess a standard compliant web browser(hopefully Google Chrome/Mozilla Firefox)
* Font Awesome > v4 (for star and half-star icons)

## TODO
* The code is cluttered a bit, probably make it a bit more modular
